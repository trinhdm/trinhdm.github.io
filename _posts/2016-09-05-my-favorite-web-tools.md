title:  "Free Web Design and Development Resources That You Didn't Know Existed"
description: The Internet is yuge. That's right, yuge. -->

I had a friend asked me this week for a list of resources that could help him jumpstart his career in web design and development. They were looking for inspirational sites for UI/UX ideas, to just plainly.. free resources. Plus, this would be a great hub for me to reference to whenever I'm in a dire need of some odd resource I can't remember (like right now, since I had to surf through my black hole of my Internet history to remember some websites). Enough rambling; here's a comprehensive list of my personal favorite resources and tools for web design and development!





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Inspiration</h2>
I've often find myself stuck in a rut, design-wise. With these inspirational sites and blogs, coming up with a nice design is as easy as counting from 1 to 10. Okay, maybe not that simple but it has definitely lessened the burden for me.

[CodePen's Design Patterns][codepen]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-codepen.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
When CodePen first released this earlier this year, I went crazy. This neatly organized bank of ideas, inspirations and examples perfectly suited my needs. It's a huge playground for anyone craving some front-end inspiration, paired with quirky descriptions for each category. I've learned a lot from playing around with and studying different pens.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Codrops][codrops]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-codrops.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Codrops is my favorite web development and web design blog, which I check up on at least once a week. This blog is filled with in-depth tutorials such as [How to Make Heat Distortion Effects with WebGL][codrops-heat] or [Inspiration for Navigation Indicators][codrops-nav]. They continuously push boundaries of how websites are built and how users interact with websites with their innovative articles and tutorials.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[CodyHouse][codyhouse]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-codyhouse.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
CodyHouse is very similar to Codrops, where they provide a free library of inspiration and tutorials on a bi-weekly basis. They also provide templates, UX patterns and more.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[hakim.se][hakim]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-hakim.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
The personal blog of Hakim El Hattab showcases an interesting array of interaction design, animations, and more.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Land Book][land-book]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-landbook.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
If you're solely looking for ideas for how to design landing pages, Land Book is a great showcase dedicated to showing the world beautiful landing pages.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[One Page Love][one-page-love]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-onepage.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Or if you're looking into creating a one page website, One Page Love is dedicated solely to present one paged websites. They also provide a library of templates as well as design elements.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Dribbble][dribbble], [Behance][behance] and [MaterialUp][materialup]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-dribbble.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-behance.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-materialup.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
I grouped these three together as they're all quite similar. You can showcase your works on these sites, or learn from other web designers.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Awwwards][awwwards] and [Siteinspire][siteinspire]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-awwwards.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-siteinspire.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Both of these websites are quite similar as well; they feature nicely designed websites on the daily. I really like surfing through these sites for creative and innovative designs when I'm running out of creative juices.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Niice][niice]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-niice.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
The last post in this section is Niice, which is a search engine for inspiration and designs. That's pretty nifty, right?





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Free Fonts</h2>
Typography conveys a personality to your website, in addition to telling a story. The type of fonts you choose for your website gives an insight to the user/reader of who you are as a person or company, sort of like your tone of voice as if you were speaking.

[Google Fonts][google-fonts]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-googlefonts.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Free, open source fonts that are optimized for the web? That sounds too good to be true, right? I think so, and that's why I love the collection over at Google Fonts.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Font Squirrel][font-squirrel]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-fontsquirrel.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Font Squirrel definitely has a bigger collection than Google Fonts, though they aren't optimized for the web. They're 100% commerical-free though!
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Lost Type][lost-type]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-losttype.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Lost Type is what you'd call a "Pay-What-You-Want" foundry, where you could donate as little as $0 to as much as $500 for a font. It's my favorite source for unique typefaces, and they continuously churn out high quality fonts.





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Free Stock Photography</h2>
Photography and imagery are a vital component of certain website designs. Even on my own personal website, the user is greeted by a full screen image. However, some stock images are pricey, but in this day and age there are numerous stock photography websites that offer their images for free (without copyright restrictions!). Here are some of my favorite websites in this category:

[Pexels][pexels]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-pexels.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Pexels is surely a gold mine of free stock photos; they have everything from landscapes to cityscapes, from baby pictures to vintage photography, from animals to cars, and everything else in between.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Unsplash][unsplash]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-unsplash.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Unsplash is an amazing stock photography website for free, high resolution photos. They release 10 new photos every 10 or so days, I believe. I like their hipsterish-vibe when it comes to the photo edits.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Start-Up Stock Photos][start-up]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-startupstock.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Start-Up Stock Photos is perfect for start-ups, bloggers, designers, developers and everyone in between.





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Free Icons</h2>
Icons are important when it comes to grabbing the user's attention. You could make your own icons, but that's a bit time consuming, isn't it? Check out these free icon libraries below to save you quite a bunch of time.

[Font Awesome][font-awesome]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-fontawesome.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Truly the gold mine of iconic font icons. From social media icons to more obscure icons like the spock symbol, this library has it all -- for free! I've used them on every project I've done.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Icomoon][icomoon]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-icomoon.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Icomoon allows you to create your own customized and optimized web fonts by choosing from over 4000 free vector icons.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Bootstrap's Glyphicons][glyphicons]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-bootstrap.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
It isn't technically free to use, but if you use Bootstrap as your grid framework, it comes bundled up with Bootstrap! [Here's][glyphicons-main] is the main website if you want to purchase the full package.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Flaticon][flaticon]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-flaticon.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
As it says on their website, "199,566 vector icons grouped in 3,269 packs" -- which is probably the largest database of icons out there.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Google's Material Icons][google-icons]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-googleicons.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Google Design released these clean material glyphs 2 years ago. Check them out, there's 750 icons and they're all a good representation of material design.





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Free Tools</h2>
This list varies from tools to help your team succeed, or for individual projects. Either way, I found all of these tools helpful since the beginning of my career.

[Coolors][coolors]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-coolors.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Coolors is an amazing and fast color scheme generator. You can easily generate a palette with a press of a button, and then adjust each color's hue/saturation/etc. If creating your own color palette isn't your cup of tea, they have a large library of palettes that other people have created. It's a win/win, right?
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Dimensions][dimensions]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-dimensions.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
A Chrome extension that allows you to measure everything you see in your browser, whether it's an image or a button.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Invision][invisionapp]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-invision.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Once you finished designing a website, you could send the .PSD/.JPG to your client and call it a day.. but what if you wanted to show how a user could interact with the website, or what if you wanted to add additional comments? Invision is a great app that solves all of your prototyping problems.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Canva's Font Combinations][carva]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-carva.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
"Typography made easy" since you only need to select your starter font, and the app does the work for you by listing other suitable font combinations.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Gyazo][gyazo]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-gyazo.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
I found Gyazo to be a super helpful tool when it comes to teamwork and collaboration. It allows you to easily take screenshots and link them to other people.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Asana][asana], [Trello][trello] and [Slack][slack]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-asana.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-trello.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-slack.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
All of these apps are various project management tools. Each one has their pros and cons, which could be read in-depth [here][comparing-comm-apps]. Out of the apps listed above, I prefer Asana more because I feel like it's more organized and cleaner, especially if you have 100 different tasks to do.





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Other Awesome Resources</h2>
[Graphic Burger][graphic-burger]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-graphicburger.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
A variety of free resources, ranging from textures to icons to templates to fonts. It seems like it has everything for a web developer and designer, and it does.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[Google's Guide to Material Design][google-material-design]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-googlematerialdesign.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
Ever wanted to learn material design, but don't know where to start? Google has a great, in-depth design about material design that is completely free.
<p style="padding-bottom:10px"></p>

[CSS Guidelines][css-guidelines]<br>
<img src="/assets/img/blog_09-05-cssguidelines.png" class="blog-full-width-img">
This guide for cleaner CSS isn't for beginners. The author goes over naming conventions, syntax and formatting, architectural information, and more. It helps to brush up on your syntax here and there, right? It definitely helped me with cleaning up my code.





<h2 style="padding-top:30px;">Wrapping Up</h2>
And this concludes my personal list of favorite free resources and tools -- I understand that it's a long list to go through, but thanks for making it this far down! I'd highly suggest you to check out these tools and see how they improve your designing and developing experience. There are definitely a lot more tools out there on the web, but I guess I haven't found them yet.
