The other day, I stumbled upon an article that discussed [The Lost Art of Visited Links][lost-art-visited]. After reading the article, I realized that web developers and designers really have ditched styling visited links. For most sites, you can only guess whether or not you clicked on that one Buzzfeed article. It's very rare sight to see nowadays.

In addition to the rarity of styling visited/unvisited links, the above article showcased the limited options for styling these links due to privacy issues. If we're only limited to <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>, and other simple styles, how could we make our visited links pop?
