description: What ever happened to them? -->

The other day, I stumbled upon an article that discussed [The Lost Art of Visited Links][lost-art-visited]. After reading the article, I realized that web developers and designers really have ditched styling visited links. For most sites, you can only guess whether or not you clicked on that one Buzzfeed article. It's very rare sight to see nowadays, even though it's could be very useful.

In addition to the rarity of styling visited/unvisited links, the above article showcased the limited options for styling these links due to privacy issues. If we're only limited to <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, <code>border-color</code>, and other simple styles, how could we make our visited links pop?

Underlining visited links with a lighter color than the link color (such as <code>border-bottom: 1px solid gray</code>) could be a useful, subtle way to differentiate unvisited links and visited links. Another way could be bold unvisited links, and have a normal font weight for visited links.

If you have any ideas about how to differentiate visited and unvisited links, I'd love to chat with you -- send me an email at <a href="mailto:doreenmtrinh@gmail.com">doreenmtrinh@gmail.com</a>
