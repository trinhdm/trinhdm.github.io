A couple of musings about using data-attributes for some cool CSS hovers.

I always thought using data-attributes were a nice touch on a website, since the developer could add supplemental content without crowding the link.

From an UX/UI perspective, this shouldn't be used for displaying important content since it won't be accessible for mobile/tablet users, as these supplemental content will only display on hover. And as far as I know, search engines can't index data-attributes because their semantic value is undetermined.

These thoughts, of course, will be continued at another time.. I just wanted to jot some stuff down first.
