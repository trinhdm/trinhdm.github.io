  <p>
    My portfolio, currently within it's third iteration, is built with Jekyll. I felt like it needed a redesign. :)

  <h3>Thought Process</h3>
  <p>
    I honestly attempted to build this redesign with React and React Router first, since I'm currently learning it through various online resources such as Code Academy.
    After much frustration, I decided to go ahead and develop a non-React version first. I haven't given up on the project yet -- you can see my progress on the Git repository for the React version <a href="https://github.com/trinhdm/react-website-layout">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Page Transitions</h3>
  <p>
    If you haven't noticed, when you click on a link on this website, the body fades out before jumping to the next web page. I never liked how jerky web pages jump from one to another (understandably, ReactJS can solve this problem), so I sought for a way to fix this problem.
  </p>

  <pre>
    $.fn.leavePage = function() {
      this.click(function(event){
        event.preventDefault();
        linkLocation = this.href;
        $('body').fadeOut(500, function(){
          window.location = linkLocation;
        });
      });
    };

    $('.transition').leavePage();
  </pre>

  <p>
    When a user clicks on a link, I call on a function that fades out the body before they go to the next page. When the user arrives on the next page, the body content fades in.
  </p>

  <h3>React</h3>
  <p>
    React is a difficult beast to conquer; it's not your normal MVC framework - in fact, it only covers the 'V' of MVC.
    Despite the mountains of obstacles and frustration I've endured, React is amazing. Reusable components help so much.
    There are a lot of things for me to learn on this journey. I need to pick up either Flux or Redux before I continue with redeveloping my portfolio as a ReactJS app. In the meanwhile, stay tuned!
