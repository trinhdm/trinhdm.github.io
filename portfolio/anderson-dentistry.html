    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Kipton Anderson approached my partner and I to design, develop and market a smooth front-end experience for his patients and visitors. As a team, we were tasked to produce a website suited for people that are hard of sight and to re-envision the user experience of his brand. My role in this project was to design and build the front-end using JS, CSS and HTML, and the back-end with PHP.
    </p>

    <h3>Prototyping A More Modern Look</h3>
    <p>
      When Dr. Anderson approached my partner and I, he had a goal of redesigning his website, but he didn't quite have the idea of what it would look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project started out with familiarizing ourselves with the functional requirements set out by Dr. Anderson. We drafted up wire-frames and mock-ups that decreased cognitive load and encouraged the user to book an appointment, or scope the site to find out more information. One of the main goals of Anderson Dentistry's redesign was to encourage content discovery; with the redesign, users can easily find more information about services offered, information about the dentistry, or general information about dental health.
    </p>

        <i>A wireframe of the home-page.</i>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      From the beginning, we spent most of our time focusing on the most important part of any website: the front page. Dr. Anderson wanted to showcase both branches of his dentistry, so we opted for a infinite slider that is located above the fold. Instead of embedding the front page with share-able and like-able links of the dentistry's social media presence, we chose to highlight the key aspects of Anderson Dentistry along with reviews from previous customers, to encourage the user to book an appointment.
    </p>

    <h3>Stylistic Choices</h3>
    <p>
      As Dr. Anderson's patients are hard of sight, we aimed to create an easily navigable website that is equipped with large text and vibrant imagery. I chose to increase the font-size and line-height to accommodate his patients, along with vibrant colors to increase engagement between the users and the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colors can affect our choice of whether or not to buy a product, so my partner and I took some time on choosing which colors would best represent Anderson Dentistry. In the end, we chose a combination of sky blue and salmon red. The color <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/psychology-of-color-and-conversions/">blue tends to cultivate trust</a> and represent serenity.
      We chose to have a shade of red as our call-to-action color, <a href="http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-marketing/quirks-of-the-color-quest">since studies have shown</a> that bright colors produces more conversions.
    </p>

    <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
    <p>
      To accommodate for various screen sizes, the website was built fully responsive; the breakpoints were determined by content, not by device size. We've created over 5 different breakpoints to serve for a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

        <i>An example of the different breakpoints within the site -- the navbar would collapse after 1160px due to the amount of content on the navbar.</i>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      During this whole process, we had a few interesting conversations on how different marketing techniques and user experience strategies (such as colors) affected conversion rates. As a developer, I've learned many tips and tricks regarding design and marketing.
      It was a pleasure to work with Dr. Kipton Anderson and my partner; the collaborative effort that we put in resulted in a easily navigable website that performs well on every device screen.
