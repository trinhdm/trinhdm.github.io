    <p>
      SoundCloud is a music application that fills the void that MySpace desperately tried to conquer - free music streaming, easy track sharing and more. SoundCloud’s current design gets the job done, but I feel like they could make several improvements to their UX/UI. It has come a long way since I started using SoundCloud back in 2013, but their interface still feels cluttered and unclean.

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      I've actually written a case study regarding my studies and my thoughts behind my creative process / redesign, which can be found <a href="/">here</a>.

    <blockquote>
      My main goal with this was to revamp SoundCloud with a clean and clear design that is easy to navigate and isn’t too heavy on visual clutter / cognitive load. In addition to that, I wanted to increase social engagement with the platform and boost visibility of lesser known SoundCloud features, such as stations.
