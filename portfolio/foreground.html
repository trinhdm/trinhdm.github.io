    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      As the sole developer, I was tasked to enhance their online presence by providing responsive designs, build the front-end using jQuery, HTML, CSS and their back-end with PHP.
    </p>

    <h3>Mobile-Friendly</h3>
    <p>
      Foreground Studios provided me with desktop layouts for each page and relied on my experience to produce suitable layouts and solutions for mobile and tablet devices. I believe that it is important to provide an excellent experience to mobile and tablet devices, while making appropriate decisions to work around its limitations. I used media queries to serve a stylesheet specifically for mobile and tablet devices, such as using tabbed content to make it more mobile-friendly.

        <i>Portfolio - Desktop version</i>

      <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 img-desc">

        </center><br>

    <h3>Filterable Content</h3>

      <i>An example of IsotopeJS</i><br>
    </div>
    <p>
      To allow the user to sort through content for each portfolio section, I used IsotopeJS in combination with MasonryJS to create a filterable layout for film categories, photo categories and design categories. To make sorting possible, each post is sorted by categories; when the user creates a post, they can create and choose multiple categories for the post to be categorized in. Within the front-end, the categories are listed as classes within each wrapper; when the user clicks on a category, I hide every wrapper that does not have the selected category within its list of classes.
    </p>

    <h3>Theme Settings</h3>

      <i>A look into Foreground's theme settings</i><br>
    </div>

    <p>
      Built into this WordPress theme are the theme settings, which allows the user to easily edit any features, content and styles on the website without the help of a webmaster. A few examples of what the user could edit would be social media links, the logo and any other related imagery, and the introductory text on the home page. Providing a theme settings page with the theme makes it easy for any user to edit the website, instead of having them directly edit the CSS and PHP files.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      With my help and experience, we produced a smooth experience for users regardless of their preferred viewing device, which was what we planned to achieve during the design phase. I look forward to working more with Foreground Studios as the website and company grows.
