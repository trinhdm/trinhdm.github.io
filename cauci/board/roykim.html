      <h2>Secretary</h2>

      <p><b>Major and Year</b> Art, 3rd year</p>

      <p><b>Hometown</b> Los Angeles</p>

      <p><b>Family Theme</b> Caillou</p>

      <p><b>First Big</b> Jason Wan</p>

      <p><b>First Year in CA</b> 2013</p>

      <p><b>Why did you join CA?</b> I joined CA mainly because I didn't like the fact that I was spending my entire freshman year lounging around in the dorms. In high school, I grew from a shy and reserved person to becoming very involved and outgoing. Coming into college, I wanted to explore a new social life outside of my hall, and CA was the perfect opportunity to meet new people as well as escape school.
      </p>

      <p><b>Why did you join board?</b> I joined board because I wanted to experience CA in a different way than I had as a member for two years. I was impressed by the student leadership and commitment in the past years, and just like how I knew I had a lot to offer to the club, CA had a lot to offer for myself. Becoming part of the board team meant I would develop my leadership and time management skills, but also create memories that would carry on to the next generations to come. Lastly, I also joined CA to meet new faces, especially alumni and those from other UC schools.
      </p>

      <p><b>What are your hobbies?</b> sniffing cologne samples from magazines<br>
trolling my friends in games<br>
ocassionally i get out of bed<br>
jk I like drawing from time to time
      </p>

      <p><b>Favorite music genre and artists?</b> I listen to anything.... maybe except country and metal<br>
I like Galantis, Jeff Bernat, Alina Baraz&Galimatias, SNAKEHIPS, and Chainsmokers.<br>
Also, I've been through my KPOP phase in high school and it kinda died out sorry............ohohoho
      </p>

      <p><b>What's your favorite CA event?</b> My favorite CA event was the Family Fun Night Event a while back ago. It was an event that gathered groups of families to get together to relax and get to know each other. Admittingly, I didn't know much people in my family but that day I was able familiarize myself to the rest of my family as well as another family while making DELICIOUS egg waffles and playing Smash.
      </p>

      <p><b>What's your favorite annual event and why?</b> I think my favorite annual event (AND MOST IMPORTANT) is the Family Revealing Dinner. We go out to eat Chinese food family style at Sam Woo in a table surrounded by your new family and BIG and there are good vibes as you introduce and get to know each other. This night in particular is where I've met some of my good friends who I still keep in touch with today.
      </p>

      <p><b>What's your favorite part of Culture Night?</b> My favorite part of Culture Night is the closing ceremonies after all the performances are done and all the participants take their bows. It's more than just the feeling of relief that CN is over, it's more of seeing how everyone's hard work and effort paid off in the end. For this year's CN, I hope I get to work with the Ninjas (props and stage crew). DATTEBAYO! BELIEVE IT!
      </p>

      <p><b>What's your favorite pun??</b> RIP boiling water, you shall be mist (I JUST FOUND IT TO FILL THIS PART IN OK bai)
