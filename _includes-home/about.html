<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  My name is <i>Doreen Trinh</i> and my background lies in International Studies with a specialization in economics from University of California, Irvine. Outside of my education at UCI, I have also studied at East China Normal University (华师大) in Shanghai.

  As the global economy continues to expand, the need to connect businesses to clients rises on a multinational scale. As a front-end developer and a specialist who understands the diversity of the worldwide economy, I bridge the gap between businesses and clients on an international scale by helping them communicate digitally through code.

  When I'm not coding the day away, you could normally find me hiking in the woods, discovering new eateries in the city or trying out 3 coffee shops a day.
