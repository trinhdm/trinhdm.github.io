            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
              This theme was inspired by a very good friend of mine who mentioned that he wanted to get into photography.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a photographer, your portfolio is your business card. Having an online presence to showcase your
              work is crucial as this world becomes increasingly digitized. As your online portfolio may be one of
              the first things you show to potential clients, your website's design is as important as the
              contents of your portfolio.
            </p>
            <p>
              While wireframing and designing this theme, I wanted it be simple. I didn't want words to
              swarm the site; rather, I wanted the photos to be the first thing that captured the user's eyes.
              I thought a grid of photos with hover-over captions perfectly captured the crucial elements that make
              up a great photography portfolio website design.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this side project, I began to understand JavaScript and CSS3 transitions more. I used it to practice what I
              knew, in addition to new methods and ideas that I have not touched upon before.
